Welcome to the garden of the absurd. Here I reflect and toil around with ideas from late-night reflections on abstract philosophies to takes on random cat videos (Yeah :( that's the most absurd range I could come up with).  

There is this cave scene from the film Dead Poets Society where the lead reads an opening (shortened) message from Thoreau - 

  

"I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life. To put to rout all that was not life and not when I had come to die to discover that I had not lived."
 

To me in this quote, the line between life and thought blurs out. To suck out all the marrow of thought is the sole purpose of this garden.

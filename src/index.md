Welcome to the garden of the absurd. Here I toil around with ideas from late-night reflections on abstract philosophies to takes on random cat videos (Yeah :( that's the most absurd range I could come up with).  

In the film Dead Poets Society, the lead reads an opening message from Thoreau during a poetry jam in a cave. It goes something like this - 

<em>
"I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life. To put to rout all that was not life and not when I had come to die to discover that I had not lived."
</em>
<br /> 
<br /> 
To **suck out all the marrow of thought** is the sole purpose of this garden.

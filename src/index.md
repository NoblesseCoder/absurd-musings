Welcome to the garden of the absurd. Here I toil around with ideas from late-night reflections on philosophies to random Technical pet projects.  

In the film Dead Poets Society, the lead reads a message from Thoreau during a poetry jam in a cave. It goes something like this - 

<em style = "color:green;">
"I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life. To put to rout all that was not life and not when I had come to die to discover that I had not lived."
</em>
<br /> 
<br /> 

To **suck out all the marrow of thought** is the sole purpose of this garden.

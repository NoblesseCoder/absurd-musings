# [absurd-musings](https://absurd-musings.netlify.app/)
absurd-musings is a digital garden intended for my absurd Musings. It's built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Static Site Generator, [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) JavaScript templating language, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers , and hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) a server-less platform for [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/). This project can be used as a template reference for other blog projects.  

### What is a digital Garden?

In simple words, it's just an evolving blog that allows the writer to reflect on past ideas and modify the content over time (can even take inputs from the readers).

Well isn't that why this garden is for?

* I can brew code, bottle space, and even put a stopper on time. (JK I know to print Hello, World! in many languages)

* I binge content - Netflix, Youtube you name it. 

* I like to think about stuff. Morality has been my recent muse(**Consulting Thinker** would be my dream profession).

* Recently I've been enjoying playing chess (blitz).

* I love anime.

* You can reach me at any of below links.

Once I took an Art Personality test to find out what type I was most suited for. I was hoping to get something like Urban sketching ( I tried to practice this but I don not seem to get the water colors right). To my utter disappointment I got Stick figures so here I am.  

Put image of me seeing myself in the mirror and this inside a thought which is watching a thought.



- I can brew code, bottle space and even put a stopper on time. (JK I know to write Hello,World! in many languages)
- I binge content - Netflix, Youtube you name it (Reccomendations are weird they lead you to ...). 
- I think about everything. Morality has been my recent muse.
- I enjoy chess (and blundering in it)
- I play all racket sports and basketball
- I love anime.
- You can reach out to me via any of these. Feel free to but me coffee or donate money. Who doesn't **want** money.
- My dream profession is to think with no purpose and get paid for doing it. You got to protect yourself from the elements.  
- Thats it. wait (Teenage fascination with Nietche's Ubermanche. Better not mention this and get judged.  )
